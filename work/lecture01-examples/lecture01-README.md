# Lecture 1 Examples Interpretation

## Overall

The example files just have names, with little to no context

## `hello.c`

Just Hello World with printf

## `loop1.c`

A for loop and a while loop

## `loop2.c`

For loops to show local and global unintialized variables

## `pointer.c`

Creates an integer variable a with a value of 5, then creates a pointer to a that stores the reference to a, then prints a little table

## `prime.c`

Checks i is prime, with full command line syntax and error checking

Learned about command line arguments:

- `argc` is the count of arguments (including the program call at index 0)
- `argv` is the array of strings (specifically using `char **argv` to designate a pointer to an array of pointers to strings ðŸ˜µ) 

## `printstr.c`

Prints an initialized str with `puts` (similar to println in C++)

## `diagnostic.c`

### PROBLEM 8

Check if is prime

### PROBLEM 9

Swap, permute, print permutations

### PROBLEM 10

Search, binary search, binary search 2

### TESTING

A bunch of tests
